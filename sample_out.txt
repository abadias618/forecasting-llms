Article Text:
 Facing families who are angry about the financial bite that high gasoline and grocery prices are taking out of their budgets, many governors are dipping into flush state coffers to offer relief in the form of rebates, gas tax suspensions and income tax refunds and cuts as they try to avoid voter backlash at the polls in November.

Just this past week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential future Democratic White House contender who is gliding toward reelection in November after fending off last year’s recall, rolled out a $9 billion proposal to hand out $400 debit cards to California drivers to help soften the impact of the nation’s highest gas prices. And in Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp – who is facing one of the toughest reelection races in the country – signed a bill Thursday that will give between $250 and $500 in tax refunds to Georgians – a move several of his rivals immediately blasted as election-year politicking. As she faces a bruising reelection campaign in Maine, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has proposed some of the most generous relief to qualified taxpayers in her state – in the form of $850 checks – to cushion the blow of inflation and gas prices.

The proposals and bill-signings are just a few examples of how ambitious and, in some cases, politically vulnerable governors are trying to show voters that they empathize with the current economic pressures, particularly in the midst of gas price hikes related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In ads across the country, Republicans are trying to use inflation to knock President Joe Biden and Democrats who control Congress. Meanwhile, Democrats, in a year in which they were already expected to face headwinds as the party in power, are still struggling to find a unified response that connects with what voters are feeling.

Jessica Taylor, who analyzes Senate and gubernatorial races for the Cook Political Report, noted that many governors have the advantage of budget tools that can provide immediate relief, unlike congressional lawmakers in a deeply polarized Washington. While some of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats, led by Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, are pressuring their colleagues and the administration to suspend the federal gas tax, for example, that could be a long and drawn-out debate in Washington. By contrast, many governors with cooperative legislatures can work quickly to cut checks.

“During the Covid-19 pandemic, voters really began to see how much of an impact governors have on their daily lives,” Taylor said. “It’s the economy right now that is the No. 1 issue, so whether it’s gas taxes, grocery taxes … it’s never a bad idea to find ways to put more money in people’s pockets, but especially during an election year, when they’re going to remember that they might have gotten that few extra hundred dollars, which can make a big difference in a family struggling.”

Because voters are most likely to blame the party in power for the hardships they are facing, Democrats – including Biden – risk appearing tone deaf if they continue to point to encouraging economic indicators.

“If you’re not feeling it at your kitchen table, and your grocery budget is higher and your gas bill is higher, those statistics don’t matter to you,” Taylor said.

Giving residents a break at the pump

States have benefited from solid economic growth and federal coronavirus relief funds flowing to them, their residents and their businesses. This has fueled growth in income and sales tax revenues and left many states with large surpluses. (The American Rescue Plan Act bars states from using the state aid in the package to cut taxes, though that provision is now tied up in federal courts.)

Many governors and lawmakers are using the windfalls to take aim at one of the most visible pain points for their residents: high gas prices. As of Friday, a gallon of gas cost $4.24 on average nationwide, up from $3.57 a month ago – though down a bit from $4.33 in mid-March, according to AAA.

At least three states have already adopted gas tax holidays and many others are considering it.

Last week, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate, signed legislation enacting a 30-day suspension of the state’s 36.1-cents-a-gallon motor fuel tax. The governor, who cannot seek reelection because of term limits, told WBAL Radio this week that he supports extending it to a total of 90 days, if the legislature approves it. The holiday, which will cost the state about $100 million a month, is being funded by Maryland’s historic surplus, estimated at $7.5 billion over a two-year span.

A 90-day gas tax break is also being pushed by Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot, a Democrat who is running to replace Hogan as governor.

In Georgia, Kemp is also temporarily halting gas taxes, in addition to providing refunds.

“In the coming days, the suspension of the 29.1 cent tax on motor fuel and 32.6 cent tax on diesel will make its way to the consumer,” the governor tweeted when he signed the bill on March 18. “Though we can’t fix everything Washington has broken, we’re doing our part to lessen the impact on Georgians’ wallets.”

The amount of motor fuel tax revenue Georgia collects – and would forgo during the hiatus – varies each month. In February, for instance, it totaled $157.4 million.

Also up for reelection is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who last November proposed more than $1 billion in temporary gas tax relief for residents. State lawmakers earlier this month approved a one-month hiatus from the 26.5-cents-a-gallon tax – lifting it only for October. (DeSantis has yet to receive the bill from the legislature and sign it.)

Democratic governors and lawmakers are also looking to help their residents cope with the spike in gas prices. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, who is running for reelection, on Thursday signed a bill that suspends the state’s 25-cents-a-gallon gas tax from April 1 through June 30, as well as eliminates fares on public buses statewide during that period. Suspending the gas tax will cost Connecticut – which has an estimated surplus of $1.8 billion – about $90 million in revenue.

“Connecticut is in a stronger fiscal position than ever before, and I am determined to use every tool available to provide relief for our residents,” Lamont said in a statement.

Newsom’s proposal would send $400 in direct payments per registered vehicle to California drivers – for up to two vehicles – and it would come from the state’s $45.7 billion surplus, but it would have to be approved by the California legislature. If it agrees, the debit cards could be headed to drivers as early as July. Eligibility would be based on vehicle registration, making it possible for low-income non-tax filers to receive the aid, as well as those who receive Social Security disability benefits, according to the governor’s office. (All individual vehicle owners in California – or those who lease – will be eligible for the $400-per-vehicle rebate, including those whose cars that run entirely on electricity).

The measure is intended to help consumers deal with the highest gas prices in the nation as California’s average price per gallon hovers at $5.90, according to AAA, as well as the sting of California’s 51.1-cents-per-gallon gas tax, which is also the highest in the nation, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators.

The debit cards are part of a broader $11 billion package Newsom is proposing that would also provide grants to transit and rail agencies to provide free transit to Californians for three months, covering the costs for some 3 million people who take buses, subways or light rail, the California governor’s office said.

Dan Schnur, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies who also teaches at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communication, said the desire from voters to see their leaders act on gas prices is particularly acute because they are reminded of how much it costs each time they pass “big signs on every other street corner.”

The rebates “provide a tangible benefit” in an election year, Schnur said, “and Newsom is smart enough to do it in the form of a debit card, which you can see and touch, as opposed to having it get lost in someone’s tax returns.”

Aid at the grocery store

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, helped set the political agenda on these pocketbook issues last year during his campaign, when he relentlessly focused on his plan to eliminate his state’s grocery tax. The connection he established with voters on those kitchen table issues was a key component of his victory against former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe in a state that had been trending blue.

As he called Virginia’s General Assembly back for a special session in April to deal with their impasse over the budget, Youngkin went up on the air with a March Madness-themed ad pressing lawmakers to approve his tax proposals, including the elimination of the state’s 2.5% grocery tax as an answer to Virginians who feel “it’s getting harder to make ends meet.” (He also recently proposed suspending Virginia’s gas tax for three months, and said the state could use more than $437 million in “unanticipated transportation revenues” to support the gas tax holiday).

Other governors and state lawmakers are also looking to lessen inflation’s impact at the supermarket. Prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs jumped 13% over the 12 months ending in February, according to Labor Department data.

The majority of the 13 states that tax groceries are considering repealing, reducing or temporarily halting the levy, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, unveiled a proposal Thursday to suspend state and local grocery sales taxes for 30 days.

“As Americans see their cost-of-living skyrocket amid historic inflation, suspending the grocery tax is the most effective way to provide direct relief to every Tennessean,” Lee said in a statement, noting that the state’s surplus allows it “to put dollars back in the pockets of hardworking Tennesseans.”

In Kansas, where Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is facing a challenge from Republican Attorney General Derek Schmidt, the steep 6.5% grocery tax has become an issue in the campaign.

Kelly announced her plan to “Axe the Food Tax” back in November. The Republican Governors Association responded with a digital ad campaign highlighting that the governor had campaigned in 2018 on reducing the grocery tax, the nation’s second highest, but vetoed a reduction of the tax that the GOP-led legislature approved in 2019.

Meanwhile, the legislature is considering a bill that would trim the grocery tax, though Kelly has continued to push for its full elimination.

Cutting income taxes

A multitude of states are also enacting or considering tax cuts and rebates. They are flush with funds thanks to higher-than-expected revenue from personal and corporate income taxes, as well as sales taxes.

Total state tax revenue collections increased more than 19%, after adjusting for inflation, between April 2021 and January 2022, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to preliminary data collected by the Urban Institute.

Most states are forecasting continued growth in tax revenues for the rest of this fiscal year, as well as the next one.

“States have long-term revenue growth. The projections are favorable in almost every state,” said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. “That can often provide opportunities for long-term tax relief, actual rate reductions or other reforms.”

This rosy financial picture has led many governors and legislatures to propose sharing the largesse with their residents – either through income tax cuts or one-time refunds.

Take Mills in Maine. Earlier this year, she proposed sending half the state budget surplus to roughly 800,000 lower- and middle-income residents in the form of one-time $500 payments, which several Republican lawmakers had called for. Last week, she raised the amount to $850 per person after the state revenue forecast was revised higher by nearly $412 million for the 2022-23 biennium to a total of $1.2 billion.

“Inflation and increased oil and gas prices resulting from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine are hitting Maine people hard. This proposal will help Maine people grapple with these increased costs by putting money directly back into their pockets,” Mills said in a statement.

Not everyone, however, is a fan of states rushing to cut income taxes – especially during turbulent times in the economy and on the global stage. Also, federal coronavirus relief funds for states, their residents and their businesses – which have supported state economies – have either ended or will run out soon.

The strong revenue growth that states have enjoyed recently is likely temporary, said Lucy Dadayan, senior research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Already, preliminary data for February shows less personal income tax revenue coming in when compared with February 2021, in part because of tax cuts that went into effect last year.

“States are going to end up in a really bad situation,” she said.



Article Text:
 Thai politicians are gearing up for a possible general election next year, even though Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha insists his military-backed coalition government will complete its four-year term in 2023.

Key indicators include a rift within the ruling Palang Pracharath Party as well as a constitutional amendment that introduced electoral changes favoring Thailand's larger parties.

In September, Prayut sacked two ministers shortly after surviving a censure debate in parliament against him and some Cabinet members.

Political sources said the premier found that the two ministers had conspired to oust him alone in the no-confidence debate. Despite a degree of reconciliation in the party, conflict remains.

Trakoon Meechai, an associate professor of Chulalongkorn University's Political Science Faculty, told Kyodo News that the chance of the government completing its four-year-term is slim if Prayut cannot withstand the political pressure, with the situation aggravated by the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.

"If the country faces a severe resurgence of COVID-19, the premier may not be able to hold onto power. He could face replacement or decide to dissolve the lower house," he said.

The Prayut-led administration has faced criticism over its pandemic management.

Although the election could be a way to relieve political tension in Thailand, the path ahead is smooth neither for Prayut nor his political rivals.

Those rivals include the largest opposition Pheu Thai Party, which consists of supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and is strong in rural areas, and the Move Forward Party, which also opposes military influence in politics and is mainly supported by the younger generation.

Pheu Thai got the greatest number of lower house seats in the 2019 general election but Palang Pracharath, which won the popular vote, was able to form a coalition government.

Prayut, a retired army general who initially came to power in a 2014 military coup, was subsequently elected prime minister by the 500-member House of Representatives and almost every member of the junta-appointed, 250-seat Senate.

In the 2019 election, the lower house members were elected using a form of mixed-member proportional representation, in which voters cast a single vote. This and other changes introduced by the military-backed 2017 Constitution were widely viewed as designed to handicap anti-junta parties like Pheu Thai.

Under the revised election system, however, the two-ballot system has been restored, with voters electing candidates from single-seat constituencies and casting a second ballot for a political party.

Whereas last time there were 350 constituency seats and 150 party-list seats up for grabs, the former has been increased to 400 and the latter reduced to 100.

Pheu Thai, which prior to 2019 had won every election since 2001 if its precursor parties are counted, has resolved to make every effort to win the next election too.

One obstacle the populist party faces is that the lower house vote for prime minister would take place in a joint session with the Senate, whose military-appointed members' term lasts until 2024.

Efforts in the legislature to further amend the Constitution to reform the Senate and to restructure the Constitutional Court and key state agencies have so far failed.

To convince the party's lawmakers and supporters on this matter, Thaksin recently installed his youngest daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra to a position of influence in Pheu Thai to cement the dominance of the Shinawatra dynasty.

Trakoon interpreted this as Thaksin resting his hope in the election and convincing Pheu Thai lawmakers to stay with the party with his daughter, who has been tipped as a future prime ministerial candidate, as a key part of its political machine.

Under the new system, small and midsize parties such as Move Forward will be struggling.

However, there is a chance that Move Forward would join a coalition if Pheu Thai wins the election with insufficient support to form a government on its own.

Some young voters have voiced support for such inter-party cooperation after the next election after coming to the realization that street rallies are not enough to help them achieve their goals of overhauling the charter and reforming the monarchy.

Naenon, a 19-year-old-student from Mahidol University whose family name is being withheld, said he does not want the Prayut-led government to return, citing its poor performance in administration.

He said Pheu Thai is capable of running the country in view of its proven past performance, even though a large number of younger Thais including him support Move Forward.

Prawravee Suwantawit, 20, a student of Thammasat University, also wishes to see Pheu Thai in power again considering its experience and the prospect of opening doors for the younger generation.

"I think Pheu Thai is one of the good choices to fix the country's problems, especially the economy," she said, adding that Move Forward still lacks experience to run the country alone.

On another hand, legal scholar Jade Donavanik saw Prayut would finish his term if the government can still handle both the political movement and the pandemic impact. Jade said only political accidents such as the departure of coalition parties or a coup could bring him down, but it is unlikely.

However, he thought that it is not easy for Prayut to secure a second term in the next election.

"Aside from being in power for too long since seizing power, Gen. Prayut has yet made any significant progress in reforming the country as promised," he said.

Regarding the student movement, Jade, who is also former adviser to the Constitution Drafting Committee, said the pro-democracy groups have been weakened by law enforcement authorities and -- in the court of public opinion -- violence including burning public properties at recent rallies in Bangkok.

He said the groups made a good start in calling for changes in politics and the constitutional monarchy, but later turned the main focus to the monarchy using ill-mannered methods.

Move Forward, the student groups and their allies have been making parallel movements in and outside the parliament to reform key establishments, including the monarchy, but have little to show for their efforts. Key leaders are being detained on various charges, including under the strict lese majeste law.

Foreseeing Thai political developments, the political academic Trakoon said all sides have to adjust themselves to the changes and avoid fomenting hatred of their opponents or seeking to destroy them.

 The Ukrainian crisis has changed several paradigms in international relations. Turkish-American relations are among them. There was a visible deterioration between these two NATO allies after Joe Biden’s election as US president.

Congressman Frank Pallone, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on Feb. 4 sent a letter to the State Department urging the Biden administration not to supply Turkey with F-16 fighter aircraft and modernization kits, due to its human rights violations and the deployment of the Russian-manufactured S-400 air defense system. Despite cool relations between Biden and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the State Department responded that the potential sale of F-16s to Turkey would serve both US and NATO security interests, particularly in the wake of the Ukrainian crisis.

This change of attitude in the US occurred because of growing awareness about the positive role that Turkey might play in the Ukrainian crisis. Turkey had good relations with both Russia and Ukraine and used this position to host two important meetings with Russia and Ukraine, one in Antalya, the other in Istanbul. It is now trying to do the same between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents.

The Euro-Atlantic community woke up, all of a sudden, to the reality that Turkey might be instrumental in bringing together the two warring sides and contribute to peace in the region. This reality softened the rigid attitude that the EU — and more so, NATO — have displayed toward Turkey in recent years. The first concrete outcome of it is, therefore, the US attitude about the sale of the F-16 fighter aircraft to Turkey.

When Turkey purchased the S-400 air defense system from Russia, both the US administration and Congress reacted harshly, and Congress imposed sanctions on Turkey via the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. It did not stop there. The US expelled Turkey from the F-35 super-fighter project, which is regarded as the main component of NATO air defense for the next 50 years. About 900 components of the aircraft were being manufactured in Turkish factories.

Ankara did everything to persuade its US counterparts that these sanctions would necessarily weaken Turkey’s defense capability with a direct impact on that of NATO’s. All reasonable explanations by the Turkish military authorities fell on deaf ears on the US side. The Ukrainian crisis helped to change the US attitude, but only on the question of the sale of F-16s. There is still no softening in the US position regarding Turkey’s expulsion from the F-35 project.

On the question of the Russian-manufactured S-400 air defense system, US negotiators unofficially proposed that Turkey make available this air defense system to Ukraine. Turkey rejected this proposal because, at the height of the Syrian crisis, some NATO allies withdrew Patriot missile batteries from Turkey at a time when it badly needed them. Ankara wants to use the S-400 in case of need and does not want to be left again exposed to attacks without proper protection.

Despite the frozen positions on two subjects — the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act and the S-400 air defense system — there is now a timid softening on the subject of the purchase of the F-16 fighter aircraft. Turkey’s demand covers the purchase of 40 F-16s and the upgrading of the existing ones in Turkey’s inventory. In other words, it is a commitment that covers a long period and consolidates Turkey’s relations with the Euro-Atlantic community as a whole. The US will be reassessing the contribution that Turkey may make to this community.

The Turkish-US negotiations on F-16s look like a breakthrough in the relations between these two NATO allies, but one swallow does not make a summer.

Another critical issue is the impact of US-Russia relations on Turkey’s Syria policy. It is unclear how the new political landscape between the US and Russia will evolve in Syria. The cooperation that the US and Russia used to maintain in Syria has now been suspended. While Russia is so deeply bogged down in the Ukrainian quagmire, it cannot be expected to play the same effective role in Syria.

If the power balance between the US and Russia in Syria tilts toward the US, Turkey will be affected by this new balance in two ways. One way is weakened Russian support for the Bashar Assad regime, and Turkey will be happy about that. However, this support will probably be kept at a level allowing the Syrian regime to float but not sink. Moscow will keep Turkey at arm’s length and avoid unnecessarily antagonizing it.

The second effect of the change in the power balance will be the continuation of the US support for Kurds. Whether the F-16 deal will be sealed or not, the US support for Kurds is likely to continue one way or another.

The Turkish-US negotiations on F-16s look like a breakthrough in the relations between these two NATO allies, but one swallow does not make a summer.

Article Text:
 One week ago, Yair Lapid addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the first time as the prime minister of Israel. He spoke for 23 minutes and covered a range of issues, including regional normalization, the threats that Israel faces from Iran, antisemitism, and the challenge of Gaza. Included in those 23 minutes were the following three sentences: “An agreement with the Palestinians, based on two states for two peoples, is the right thing for Israel’s security, for Israel’s economy, and for the future of our children…Despite all the obstacles, still today a large majority of Israelis support the vision of this two-state solution. I am one of them.”

In the hours after Lapid’s U.N. speech, media coverage in Israel focused on his rhetorical embrace of two states above and beyond anything else he said. Even before Lapid uttered those sentences, he came under a hailstorm of criticism back home, both from members of the opposition and members of his coalition. The criticism from Lapid’s right was that he is naïve to believe that two states is advisable, that he is endangering Israel and rewarding terrorism by putting the Palestinian issue back on the global agenda after Binyamin Netanyahu’s allegedly successful efforts to sideline it, and that the era of two states is over. The criticism from Lapid’s left was that he is merely mouthing empty platitudes without taking any tangible steps to bring two states to fruition, and that without ending the occupation or reentering negotiations with the Palestinians immediately, the era of two states will soon be over. With the exceptions of Labor, Meretz, and his colleagues in Yesh Atid, nobody seemed to be happy with Lapid, and those who want to see Israel take more drastic action dismissed what he said as having little impact on the future direction of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

It should go without saying that words can only go so far. Without actual steps to reduce Israel’s footprint and lessen its occupation in Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, preserve the territorial viability of a future Palestinian state, ensure a baseline of security for Israelis in any separation from the Palestinians, and work with the Palestinians to give them a clear political horizon and not only an economic one, any Israeli prime minister can talk about two states until the end of time and it won’t resolve the situation. But it is a mistake to dismiss Lapid’s words as irrelevant and as an easily identified ruse or misdirection. There are at least three good reasons why what Lapid says matters and why he deserves real credit for his U.N. speech.

First, Lapid’s rhetoric shapes the conversation in Israel and the way that Israelis think about the future of their relationship with the Palestinians. Even in this era of polarized and siloed journalism and social media domination, the words of a country’s leader filter through and set the agenda. Israelis have spent years hearing their prime minister either refuse to say the words “two states” or outright oppose a two-state outcome as dangerous and declare it categorically off the table. That influences whether they think that two states is advisable, possible, or in Israel’s basic interests, and while it is not the only variable at work, it is reflected in polls over the past decade that consistently show a steady decrease in the number of Israelis supporting two states and believing that such an outcome is achievable. Quite simply, a prime minister who takes the opposite tack and reminds Israelis that a two-state outcome is a core Israeli interest will impact Israelis’ views irrespective of whether policy in the short term follows or remains static. The key to moving Israeli policy in the long term lies with creating a critical mass of voters who want to see a two-state agenda implemented, and that has to start with political leadership that shapes opinion. Lapid’s U.N. speech was that start.

Second, Lapid said what he said despite operating in a political environment in which supporting two states costs more votes than it gains, and he did it less than six weeks before an election. While it may help him when it comes to putting a potential coalition together if it clears the way for Arab parties—particularly Hadash-Ta’al—to recommend him for prime minister and support a government from within or without, that support might also be canceled out on the other side if it makes it harder for the New Hope component of the National Unity Party to join a government. It also highlighted the real divisions within his potential coalition ahead of the election, as Gideon Sa’ar and Avigdor Liberman criticized Lapid without hesitation, which was juxtaposed with the unwavering unanimity in opposition to two states on the other side of the political divide. It is hard to make the case that raising this issue is a macro political winner for Lapid, even if there are some micro benefits (including sowing chaos in Benny Gantz’s backyard and reminding people why Lapid rather than Gantz is the more serious candidate for prime minister), yet Lapid raised it anyway. Following four elections where two states was almost entirely absent from the campaigns’ agendas and voters’ radars, Lapid placed it front and center as a campaign issue. This suggests that Lapid genuinely believes in two states and its importance as a core Israeli interest, and also suggests a political bravery that is uncommon these days. Both of those make Lapid’s speech deserving of praise, even if the ultimate proof will be in the pudding.

Lastly, Lapid’s words will act as a signal for other actors to elevate two states as a renewed priority. While Jordan to a large extent and Egypt to a lesser extent keep the two state issue front and center, the Abraham Accords states generally prefer to focus on their bilateral relationships with Israel without diving too deeply into Israeli-Palestinian issues beyond the margins. The Biden administration consistently talks about two states, but has also not wanted to push the Israeli government—whether it was headed by Netanyahu, Naftali Bennett, or Lapid—too hard on political steps and spark a high-profile argument when it was clear that Israeli leaders were not at all interested or inclined to do anything. An Israeli prime minister who not only does not avoid the issue but raises it on his own initiative will have downstream effects on outside actors; this acknowledgement will tacitly encourage them to be more involved as well by smoothing the path toward initiatives both large and small pertaining to two states that will not be met with immediate resistance. The Emiratis and Bahrainis are not going to insert themselves on this issue without some public indication from Israel that two states is not a dead letter, which is why Lapid’s words at the U.N.—coming after similar sentiments from President Biden, King Abdullah, and others—matter.

Lapid is not about to sit down for negotiations with Mahmoud Abbas, the U.S. is not about to appoint a peace envoy to engage in shuttle diplomacy between Jerusalem and Ramallah, and no international peace conference is about to be convened. Israelis and Palestinians have a giant hole out of which to climb and they are close to rock bottom. But dismissing Lapid’s embrace of two states as irrelevant misses the impact it will begin to have, and he should be commended without cynicism and without assuming that his words were an empty public relations stunt. Anyone who wants to see a two-state outcome should be encouraged by Lapid and view this as an early step in a long journey.

news ['Facing families who are angry about the financial bite that high gasoline and grocery prices are taking out of their budgets, many governors are dipping into flush state coffers to offer relief in the form of rebates, gas tax suspensions and income tax refunds and cuts as they try to avoid voter backlash at the polls in November.\n\nJust this past week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential future Democratic White House contender who is gliding toward reelection in November after fending off last year’s recall, rolled out a $9 billion proposal to hand out $400 debit cards to California drivers to help soften the impact of the nation’s highest gas prices. And in Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp – who is facing one of the toughest reelection races in the country – signed a bill Thursday that will give between $250 and $500 in tax refunds to Georgians – a move several of his rivals immediately blasted as election-year politicking. As she faces a bruising reelection campaign in Maine, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has proposed some of the most generous relief to qualified taxpayers in her state – in the form of $850 checks – to cushion the blow of inflation and gas prices.\n\nThe proposals and bill-signings are just a few examples of how ambitious and, in some cases, politically vulnerable governors are trying to show voters that they empathize with the current economic pressures, particularly in the midst of gas price hikes related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In ads across the country, Republicans are trying to use inflation to knock President Joe Biden and Democrats who control Congress. Meanwhile, Democrats, in a year in which they were already expected to face headwinds as the party in power, are still struggling to find a unified response that connects with what voters are feeling.\n\nJessica Taylor, who analyzes Senate and gubernatorial races for the Cook Political Report, noted that many governors have the advantage of budget tools that can provide immediate relief, unlike congressional lawmakers in a deeply polarized Washington. While some of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats, led by Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, are pressuring their colleagues and the administration to suspend the federal gas tax, for example, that could be a long and drawn-out debate in Washington. By contrast, many governors with cooperative legislatures can work quickly to cut checks.\n\n“During the Covid-19 pandemic, voters really began to see how much of an impact governors have on their daily lives,” Taylor said. “It’s the economy right now that is the No. 1 issue, so whether it’s gas taxes, grocery taxes … it’s never a bad idea to find ways to put more money in people’s pockets, but especially during an election year, when they’re going to remember that they might have gotten that few extra hundred dollars, which can make a big difference in a family struggling.”\n\nBecause voters are most likely to blame the party in power for the hardships they are facing, Democrats – including Biden – risk appearing tone deaf if they continue to point to encouraging economic indicators.\n\n“If you’re not feeling it at your kitchen table, and your grocery budget is higher and your gas bill is higher, those statistics don’t matter to you,” Taylor said.\n\nGiving residents a break at the pump\n\nStates have benefited from solid economic growth and federal coronavirus relief funds flowing to them, their residents and their businesses. This has fueled growth in income and sales tax revenues and left many states with large surpluses. (The American Rescue Plan Act bars states from using the state aid in the package to cut taxes, though that provision is now tied up in federal courts.)\n\nMany governors and lawmakers are using the windfalls to take aim at one of the most visible pain points for their residents: high gas prices. As of Friday, a gallon of gas cost $4.24 on average nationwide, up from $3.57 a month ago – though down a bit from $4.33 in mid-March, according to AAA.\n\nAt least three states have already adopted gas tax holidays and many others are considering it.\n\nLast week, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate, signed legislation enacting a 30-day suspension of the state’s 36.1-cents-a-gallon motor fuel tax. The governor, who cannot seek reelection because of term limits, told WBAL Radio this week that he supports extending it to a total of 90 days, if the legislature approves it. The holiday, which will cost the state about $100 million a month, is being funded by Maryland’s historic surplus, estimated at $7.5 billion over a two-year span.\n\nA 90-day gas tax break is also being pushed by Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot, a Democrat who is running to replace Hogan as governor.\n\nIn Georgia, Kemp is also temporarily halting gas taxes, in addition to providing refunds.\n\n“In the coming days, the suspension of the 29.1 cent tax on motor fuel and 32.6 cent tax on diesel will make its way to the consumer,” the governor tweeted when he signed the bill on March 18. “Though we can’t fix everything Washington has broken, we’re doing our part to lessen the impact on Georgians’ wallets.”\n\nThe amount of motor fuel tax revenue Georgia collects – and would forgo during the hiatus – varies each month. In February, for instance, it totaled $157.4 million.\n\nAlso up for reelection is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who last November proposed more than $1 billion in temporary gas tax relief for residents. State lawmakers earlier this month approved a one-month hiatus from the 26.5-cents-a-gallon tax – lifting it only for October. (DeSantis has yet to receive the bill from the legislature and sign it.)\n\nDemocratic governors and lawmakers are also looking to help their residents cope with the spike in gas prices. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, who is running for reelection, on Thursday signed a bill that suspends the state’s 25-cents-a-gallon gas tax from April 1 through June 30, as well as eliminates fares on public buses statewide during that period. Suspending the gas tax will cost Connecticut – which has an estimated surplus of $1.8 billion – about $90 million in revenue.\n\n“Connecticut is in a stronger fiscal position than ever before, and I am determined to use every tool available to provide relief for our residents,” Lamont said in a statement.\n\nNewsom’s proposal would send $400 in direct payments per registered vehicle to California drivers – for up to two vehicles – and it would come from the state’s $45.7 billion surplus, but it would have to be approved by the California legislature. If it agrees, the debit cards could be headed to drivers as early as July. Eligibility would be based on vehicle registration, making it possible for low-income non-tax filers to receive the aid, as well as those who receive Social Security disability benefits, according to the governor’s office. (All individual vehicle owners in California – or those who lease – will be eligible for the $400-per-vehicle rebate, including those whose cars that run entirely on electricity).\n\nThe measure is intended to help consumers deal with the highest gas prices in the nation as California’s average price per gallon hovers at $5.90, according to AAA, as well as the sting of California’s 51.1-cents-per-gallon gas tax, which is also the highest in the nation, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators.\n\nThe debit cards are part of a broader $11 billion package Newsom is proposing that would also provide grants to transit and rail agencies to provide free transit to Californians for three months, covering the costs for some 3 million people who take buses, subways or light rail, the California governor’s office said.\n\nDan Schnur, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies who also teaches at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communication, said the desire from voters to see their leaders act on gas prices is particularly acute because they are reminded of how much it costs each time they pass “big signs on every other street corner.”\n\nThe rebates “provide a tangible benefit” in an election year, Schnur said, “and Newsom is smart enough to do it in the form of a debit card, which you can see and touch, as opposed to having it get lost in someone’s tax returns.”\n\nAid at the grocery store\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, helped set the political agenda on these pocketbook issues last year during his campaign, when he relentlessly focused on his plan to eliminate his state’s grocery tax. The connection he established with voters on those kitchen table issues was a key component of his victory against former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe in a state that had been trending blue.\n\nAs he called Virginia’s General Assembly back for a special session in April to deal with their impasse over the budget, Youngkin went up on the air with a March Madness-themed ad pressing lawmakers to approve his tax proposals, including the elimination of the state’s 2.5% grocery tax as an answer to Virginians who feel “it’s getting harder to make ends meet.” (He also recently proposed suspending Virginia’s gas tax for three months, and said the state could use more than $437 million in “unanticipated transportation revenues” to support the gas tax holiday).\n\nOther governors and state lawmakers are also looking to lessen inflation’s impact at the supermarket. Prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs jumped 13% over the 12 months ending in February, according to Labor Department data.\n\nThe majority of the 13 states that tax groceries are considering repealing, reducing or temporarily halting the levy, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, unveiled a proposal Thursday to suspend state and local grocery sales taxes for 30 days.\n\n“As Americans see their cost-of-living skyrocket amid historic inflation, suspending the grocery tax is the most effective way to provide direct relief to every Tennessean,” Lee said in a statement, noting that the state’s surplus allows it “to put dollars back in the pockets of hardworking Tennesseans.”\n\nIn Kansas, where Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is facing a challenge from Republican Attorney General Derek Schmidt, the steep 6.5% grocery tax has become an issue in the campaign.\n\nKelly announced her plan to “Axe the Food Tax” back in November. The Republican Governors Association responded with a digital ad campaign highlighting that the governor had campaigned in 2018 on reducing the grocery tax, the nation’s second highest, but vetoed a reduction of the tax that the GOP-led legislature approved in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, the legislature is considering a bill that would trim the grocery tax, though Kelly has continued to push for its full elimination.\n\nCutting income taxes\n\nA multitude of states are also enacting or considering tax cuts and rebates. They are flush with funds thanks to higher-than-expected revenue from personal and corporate income taxes, as well as sales taxes.\n\nTotal state tax revenue collections increased more than 19%, after adjusting for inflation, between April 2021 and January 2022, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to preliminary data collected by the Urban Institute.\n\nMost states are forecasting continued growth in tax revenues for the rest of this fiscal year, as well as the next one.\n\n“States have long-term revenue growth. The projections are favorable in almost every state,” said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. “That can often provide opportunities for long-term tax relief, actual rate reductions or other reforms.”\n\nThis rosy financial picture has led many governors and legislatures to propose sharing the largesse with their residents – either through income tax cuts or one-time refunds.\n\nTake Mills in Maine. Earlier this year, she proposed sending half the state budget surplus to roughly 800,000 lower- and middle-income residents in the form of one-time $500 payments, which several Republican lawmakers had called for. Last week, she raised the amount to $850 per person after the state revenue forecast was revised higher by nearly $412 million for the 2022-23 biennium to a total of $1.2 billion.\n\n“Inflation and increased oil and gas prices resulting from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine are hitting Maine people hard. This proposal will help Maine people grapple with these increased costs by putting money directly back into their pockets,” Mills said in a statement.\n\nNot everyone, however, is a fan of states rushing to cut income taxes – especially during turbulent times in the economy and on the global stage. Also, federal coronavirus relief funds for states, their residents and their businesses – which have supported state economies – have either ended or will run out soon.\n\nThe strong revenue growth that states have enjoyed recently is likely temporary, said Lucy Dadayan, senior research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Already, preliminary data for February shows less personal income tax revenue coming in when compared with February 2021, in part because of tax cuts that went into effect last year.\n\n“States are going to end up in a really bad situation,” she said.', 'Thai politicians are gearing up for a possible general election next year, even though Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha insists his military-backed coalition government will complete its four-year term in 2023.\n\nKey indicators include a rift within the ruling Palang Pracharath Party as well as a constitutional amendment that introduced electoral changes favoring Thailand\'s larger parties.\n\nIn September, Prayut sacked two ministers shortly after surviving a censure debate in parliament against him and some Cabinet members.\n\nPolitical sources said the premier found that the two ministers had conspired to oust him alone in the no-confidence debate. Despite a degree of reconciliation in the party, conflict remains.\n\nTrakoon Meechai, an associate professor of Chulalongkorn University\'s Political Science Faculty, told Kyodo News that the chance of the government completing its four-year-term is slim if Prayut cannot withstand the political pressure, with the situation aggravated by the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n"If the country faces a severe resurgence of COVID-19, the premier may not be able to hold onto power. He could face replacement or decide to dissolve the lower house," he said.\n\nThe Prayut-led administration has faced criticism over its pandemic management.\n\nAlthough the election could be a way to relieve political tension in Thailand, the path ahead is smooth neither for Prayut nor his political rivals.\n\nThose rivals include the largest opposition Pheu Thai Party, which consists of supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and is strong in rural areas, and the Move Forward Party, which also opposes military influence in politics and is mainly supported by the younger generation.\n\nPheu Thai got the greatest number of lower house seats in the 2019 general election but Palang Pracharath, which won the popular vote, was able to form a coalition government.\n\nPrayut, a retired army general who initially came to power in a 2014 military coup, was subsequently elected prime minister by the 500-member House of Representatives and almost every member of the junta-appointed, 250-seat Senate.\n\nIn the 2019 election, the lower house members were elected using a form of mixed-member proportional representation, in which voters cast a single vote. This and other changes introduced by the military-backed 2017 Constitution were widely viewed as designed to handicap anti-junta parties like Pheu Thai.\n\nUnder the revised election system, however, the two-ballot system has been restored, with voters electing candidates from single-seat constituencies and casting a second ballot for a political party.\n\nWhereas last time there were 350 constituency seats and 150 party-list seats up for grabs, the former has been increased to 400 and the latter reduced to 100.\n\nPheu Thai, which prior to 2019 had won every election since 2001 if its precursor parties are counted, has resolved to make every effort to win the next election too.\n\nOne obstacle the populist party faces is that the lower house vote for prime minister would take place in a joint session with the Senate, whose military-appointed members\' term lasts until 2024.\n\nEfforts in the legislature to further amend the Constitution to reform the Senate and to restructure the Constitutional Court and key state agencies have so far failed.\n\nTo convince the party\'s lawmakers and supporters on this matter, Thaksin recently installed his youngest daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra to a position of influence in Pheu Thai to cement the dominance of the Shinawatra dynasty.\n\nTrakoon interpreted this as Thaksin resting his hope in the election and convincing Pheu Thai lawmakers to stay with the party with his daughter, who has been tipped as a future prime ministerial candidate, as a key part of its political machine.\n\nUnder the new system, small and midsize parties such as Move Forward will be struggling.\n\nHowever, there is a chance that Move Forward would join a coalition if Pheu Thai wins the election with insufficient support to form a government on its own.\n\nSome young voters have voiced support for such inter-party cooperation after the next election after coming to the realization that street rallies are not enough to help them achieve their goals of overhauling the charter and reforming the monarchy.\n\nNaenon, a 19-year-old-student from Mahidol University whose family name is being withheld, said he does not want the Prayut-led government to return, citing its poor performance in administration.\n\nHe said Pheu Thai is capable of running the country in view of its proven past performance, even though a large number of younger Thais including him support Move Forward.\n\nPrawravee Suwantawit, 20, a student of Thammasat University, also wishes to see Pheu Thai in power again considering its experience and the prospect of opening doors for the younger generation.\n\n"I think Pheu Thai is one of the good choices to fix the country\'s problems, especially the economy," she said, adding that Move Forward still lacks experience to run the country alone.\n\nOn another hand, legal scholar Jade Donavanik saw Prayut would finish his term if the government can still handle both the political movement and the pandemic impact. Jade said only political accidents such as the departure of coalition parties or a coup could bring him down, but it is unlikely.\n\nHowever, he thought that it is not easy for Prayut to secure a second term in the next election.\n\n"Aside from being in power for too long since seizing power, Gen. Prayut has yet made any significant progress in reforming the country as promised," he said.\n\nRegarding the student movement, Jade, who is also former adviser to the Constitution Drafting Committee, said the pro-democracy groups have been weakened by law enforcement authorities and -- in the court of public opinion -- violence including burning public properties at recent rallies in Bangkok.\n\nHe said the groups made a good start in calling for changes in politics and the constitutional monarchy, but later turned the main focus to the monarchy using ill-mannered methods.\n\nMove Forward, the student groups and their allies have been making parallel movements in and outside the parliament to reform key establishments, including the monarchy, but have little to show for their efforts. Key leaders are being detained on various charges, including under the strict lese majeste law.\n\nForeseeing Thai political developments, the political academic Trakoon said all sides have to adjust themselves to the changes and avoid fomenting hatred of their opponents or seeking to destroy them.\n\n(Raveebhorn Chaiprapa contributed to this story)\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nBangkok, other parts of Thailand reopen to foreign tourists\n\nThai PM survives no-confidence vote amid criticism on virus response', "The Ukrainian crisis has changed several paradigms in international relations. Turkish-American relations are among them. There was a visible deterioration between these two NATO allies after Joe Biden’s election as US president.\n\nCongressman Frank Pallone, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on Feb. 4 sent a letter to the State Department urging the Biden administration not to supply Turkey with F-16 fighter aircraft and modernization kits, due to its human rights violations and the deployment of the Russian-manufactured S-400 air defense system. Despite cool relations between Biden and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the State Department responded that the potential sale of F-16s to Turkey would serve both US and NATO security interests, particularly in the wake of the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nThis change of attitude in the US occurred because of growing awareness about the positive role that Turkey might play in the Ukrainian crisis. Turkey had good relations with both Russia and Ukraine and used this position to host two important meetings with Russia and Ukraine, one in Antalya, the other in Istanbul. It is now trying to do the same between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents.\n\nThe Euro-Atlantic community woke up, all of a sudden, to the reality that Turkey might be instrumental in bringing together the two warring sides and contribute to peace in the region. This reality softened the rigid attitude that the EU — and more so, NATO — have displayed toward Turkey in recent years. The first concrete outcome of it is, therefore, the US attitude about the sale of the F-16 fighter aircraft to Turkey.\n\nWhen Turkey purchased the S-400 air defense system from Russia, both the US administration and Congress reacted harshly, and Congress imposed sanctions on Turkey via the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. It did not stop there. The US expelled Turkey from the F-35 super-fighter project, which is regarded as the main component of NATO air defense for the next 50 years. About 900 components of the aircraft were being manufactured in Turkish factories.\n\nAnkara did everything to persuade its US counterparts that these sanctions would necessarily weaken Turkey’s defense capability with a direct impact on that of NATO’s. All reasonable explanations by the Turkish military authorities fell on deaf ears on the US side. The Ukrainian crisis helped to change the US attitude, but only on the question of the sale of F-16s. There is still no softening in the US position regarding Turkey’s expulsion from the F-35 project.\n\nOn the question of the Russian-manufactured S-400 air defense system, US negotiators unofficially proposed that Turkey make available this air defense system to Ukraine. Turkey rejected this proposal because, at the height of the Syrian crisis, some NATO allies withdrew Patriot missile batteries from Turkey at a time when it badly needed them. Ankara wants to use the S-400 in case of need and does not want to be left again exposed to attacks without proper protection.\n\nDespite the frozen positions on two subjects — the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act and the S-400 air defense system — there is now a timid softening on the subject of the purchase of the F-16 fighter aircraft. Turkey’s demand covers the purchase of 40 F-16s and the upgrading of the existing ones in Turkey’s inventory. In other words, it is a commitment that covers a long period and consolidates Turkey’s relations with the Euro-Atlantic community as a whole. The US will be reassessing the contribution that Turkey may make to this community.\n\nThe Turkish-US negotiations on F-16s look like a breakthrough in the relations between these two NATO allies, but one swallow does not make a summer.\n\nYasar Yakis\n\nAnother critical issue is the impact of US-Russia relations on Turkey’s Syria policy. It is unclear how the new political landscape between the US and Russia will evolve in Syria. The cooperation that the US and Russia used to maintain in Syria has now been suspended. While Russia is so deeply bogged down in the Ukrainian quagmire, it cannot be expected to play the same effective role in Syria.\n\nIf the power balance between the US and Russia in Syria tilts toward the US, Turkey will be affected by this new balance in two ways. One way is weakened Russian support for the Bashar Assad regime, and Turkey will be happy about that. However, this support will probably be kept at a level allowing the Syrian regime to float but not sink. Moscow will keep Turkey at arm’s length and avoid unnecessarily antagonizing it.\n\nThe second effect of the change in the power balance will be the continuation of the US support for Kurds. Whether the F-16 deal will be sealed or not, the US support for Kurds is likely to continue one way or another.\n\nThe Turkish-US negotiations on F-16s look like a breakthrough in the relations between these two NATO allies, but one swallow does not make a summer.\n\nYasar Yakis is a former foreign minister of Turkey and founding member of the ruling AK Party. Twitter: @yakis_yasar\n\nDisclaimer: Views expressed by writers in this section are their own and do not necessarily reflect Arab News' point of view", 'One week ago, Yair Lapid addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the first time as the prime minister of Israel. He spoke for 23 minutes and covered a range of issues, including regional normalization, the threats that Israel faces from Iran, antisemitism, and the challenge of Gaza. Included in those 23 minutes were the following three sentences: “An agreement with the Palestinians, based on two states for two peoples, is the right thing for Israel’s security, for Israel’s economy, and for the future of our children…Despite all the obstacles, still today a large majority of Israelis support the vision of this two-state solution. I am one of them.”\n\nIn the hours after Lapid’s U.N. speech, media coverage in Israel focused on his rhetorical embrace of two states above and beyond anything else he said. Even before Lapid uttered those sentences, he came under a hailstorm of criticism back home, both from members of the opposition and members of his coalition. The criticism from Lapid’s right was that he is naïve to believe that two states is advisable, that he is endangering Israel and rewarding terrorism by putting the Palestinian issue back on the global agenda after Binyamin Netanyahu’s allegedly successful efforts to sideline it, and that the era of two states is over. The criticism from Lapid’s left was that he is merely mouthing empty platitudes without taking any tangible steps to bring two states to fruition, and that without ending the occupation or reentering negotiations with the Palestinians immediately, the era of two states will soon be over. With the exceptions of Labor, Meretz, and his colleagues in Yesh Atid, nobody seemed to be happy with Lapid, and those who want to see Israel take more drastic action dismissed what he said as having little impact on the future direction of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIt should go without saying that words can only go so far. Without actual steps to reduce Israel’s footprint and lessen its occupation in Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, preserve the territorial viability of a future Palestinian state, ensure a baseline of security for Israelis in any separation from the Palestinians, and work with the Palestinians to give them a clear political horizon and not only an economic one, any Israeli prime minister can talk about two states until the end of time and it won’t resolve the situation. But it is a mistake to dismiss Lapid’s words as irrelevant and as an easily identified ruse or misdirection. There are at least three good reasons why what Lapid says matters and why he deserves real credit for his U.N. speech.\n\nFirst, Lapid’s rhetoric shapes the conversation in Israel and the way that Israelis think about the future of their relationship with the Palestinians. Even in this era of polarized and siloed journalism and social media domination, the words of a country’s leader filter through and set the agenda. Israelis have spent years hearing their prime minister either refuse to say the words “two states” or outright oppose a two-state outcome as dangerous and declare it categorically off the table. That influences whether they think that two states is advisable, possible, or in Israel’s basic interests, and while it is not the only variable at work, it is reflected in polls over the past decade that consistently show a steady decrease in the number of Israelis supporting two states and believing that such an outcome is achievable. Quite simply, a prime minister who takes the opposite tack and reminds Israelis that a two-state outcome is a core Israeli interest will impact Israelis’ views irrespective of whether policy in the short term follows or remains static. The key to moving Israeli policy in the long term lies with creating a critical mass of voters who want to see a two-state agenda implemented, and that has to start with political leadership that shapes opinion. Lapid’s U.N. speech was that start.\n\nSecond, Lapid said what he said despite operating in a political environment in which supporting two states costs more votes than it gains, and he did it less than six weeks before an election. While it may help him when it comes to putting a potential coalition together if it clears the way for Arab parties—particularly Hadash-Ta’al—to recommend him for prime minister and support a government from within or without, that support might also be canceled out on the other side if it makes it harder for the New Hope component of the National Unity Party to join a government. It also highlighted the real divisions within his potential coalition ahead of the election, as Gideon Sa’ar and Avigdor Liberman criticized Lapid without hesitation, which was juxtaposed with the unwavering unanimity in opposition to two states on the other side of the political divide. It is hard to make the case that raising this issue is a macro political winner for Lapid, even if there are some micro benefits (including sowing chaos in Benny Gantz’s backyard and reminding people why Lapid rather than Gantz is the more serious candidate for prime minister), yet Lapid raised it anyway. Following four elections where two states was almost entirely absent from the campaigns’ agendas and voters’ radars, Lapid placed it front and center as a campaign issue. This suggests that Lapid genuinely believes in two states and its importance as a core Israeli interest, and also suggests a political bravery that is uncommon these days. Both of those make Lapid’s speech deserving of praise, even if the ultimate proof will be in the pudding.\n\nLastly, Lapid’s words will act as a signal for other actors to elevate two states as a renewed priority. While Jordan to a large extent and Egypt to a lesser extent keep the two state issue front and center, the Abraham Accords states generally prefer to focus on their bilateral relationships with Israel without diving too deeply into Israeli-Palestinian issues beyond the margins. The Biden administration consistently talks about two states, but has also not wanted to push the Israeli government—whether it was headed by Netanyahu, Naftali Bennett, or Lapid—too hard on political steps and spark a high-profile argument when it was clear that Israeli leaders were not at all interested or inclined to do anything. An Israeli prime minister who not only does not avoid the issue but raises it on his own initiative will have downstream effects on outside actors; this acknowledgement will tacitly encourage them to be more involved as well by smoothing the path toward initiatives both large and small pertaining to two states that will not be met with immediate resistance. The Emiratis and Bahrainis are not going to insert themselves on this issue without some public indication from Israel that two states is not a dead letter, which is why Lapid’s words at the U.N.—coming after similar sentiments from President Biden, King Abdullah, and others—matter.\n\nLapid is not about to sit down for negotiations with Mahmoud Abbas, the U.S. is not about to appoint a peace envoy to engage in shuttle diplomacy between Jerusalem and Ramallah, and no international peace conference is about to be convened. Israelis and Palestinians have a giant hole out of which to climb and they are close to rock bottom. But dismissing Lapid’s embrace of two states as irrelevant misses the impact it will begin to have, and he should be commended without cynicism and without assuming that his words were an empty public relations stunt. Anyone who wants to see a two-state outcome should be encouraged by Lapid and view this as an early step in a long journey.']

summary Based on the article provided, here are some points that could be used to forecast the winner of the 2024 presidential election:

1. Economic conditions: The article highlights that Democrats are struggling to find a unified response to the current economic pressures, particularly high gas prices, while Republicans are using inflation to attack President Joe Biden and Democrats who control Congress. If the economy continues to be a major concern for voters, it could benefit Republicans in the election.
2. State governor races: The article notes that many governors, including Democrats, are trying to show voters that they empathize with the current economic pressures by offering relief measures such as rebates, gas tax suspensions, and income tax refunds. If these governors are successful in providing relief to their constituents, it could help them in their reelection bids and potentially boost their party's chances in the presidential election.
3. Political vulnerabilities: The article mentions that some Democratic governors are facing tough reelection campaigns, which could be a sign of political vulnerabilities for their party. If these governors are unable to overcome their challengers, it could impact the party's chances in the presidential election.
4. Republican opposition: The article notes that Republicans are trying to use inflation to attack President Biden and Democrats, which could be an effective strategy if inflation continues to be a major concern for voters. If Republicans are able to capitalize on this issue, it could help them in the election.
5. Surplus funds: The article highlights that many states are benefiting from solid economic growth and federal coronavirus relief funds, which could be used to fund tax cuts and other relief measures. If these states are able to provide significant relief to their residents, it could help their governors and party in the presidential election.

Based on these points, it is difficult to predict with certainty who will win the 2024 presidential election. However, if the economy continues to be a major concern for voters and Republicans are able to effectively capitalize on inflation and political vulnerabilities, it could potentially benefit them in the election.
summary In 100 words or less, the article suggests that the 2024 Thai general election is highly anticipated and uncertain, with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha's military-backed coalition government facing challenges from political rivals. The Pheu Thai Party, led by Thaksin Shinawatra's daughter Paetongtarn, is determined to win the election and restore the Shinawatra dynasty's influence. However, the party faces obstacles, including the lower house vote for prime minister taking place in a joint session with the Senate, whose military-appointed members' term lasts until 2024. Small and midsize parties, such as Move Forward, may struggle, but there is a chance they could join a coalition if Pheu Thai wins with insufficient support. The article also highlights the student movement's weakened state and the possibility of political adjustments to avoid hatred and destruction of opponents. Based on these factors, it is difficult to predict who will win the election.
summary In light of the recent developments in Turkish-American relations, particularly the potential sale of F-16 fighter aircraft to Turkey, it is difficult to predict with certainty who will win the 2024 election. However, based on the current political landscape and the evolving dynamics between the US and Turkey, here are some possible scenarios:

1. Joe Biden wins re-election: If President Biden wins re-election in 2024, it is likely that the US will continue to prioritize its strategic partnership with Turkey, particularly in the context of the Ukrainian crisis. Biden may view the sale of F-16s to Turkey as a way to strengthen their alliance and demonstrate US support for Turkey's security and defense capabilities.
2. Donald Trump returns to office: If Trump wins the election in 2024, it is possible that he may take a harder line on Turkey, particularly on issues related to human rights and security. Trump has been critical of Turkey's purchase of the Russian-manufactured S-400 air defense system, and he may view the potential sale of F-16s to Turkey as a way to exert pressure on Ankara.
3. Third-party candidate emerges: It is possible that a third-party candidate could emerge in the 2024 election, potentially shaking up the race and influencing the outcome. If a candidate with a strong stance on Turkey-US relations were to emerge, it could impact the outcome of the election.
4. Geopolitical developments in the region: The geopolitical landscape in the region could also play a role in the 2024 election. If there are significant developments in the Middle East or Eastern Europe that impact US-Turkey relations, it could influence the election outcome.

In conclusion, while it is difficult to predict the winner of the 2024 election with certainty, the evolving dynamics between the US and Turkey will likely play a significant role in shaping the election outcome. The potential sale of F-16s to Turkey is a significant development that could impact US-Turkey relations and potentially influence the election.
summary In 100 words or less, the article argues that Yair Lapid's speech at the United Nations General Assembly, where he expressed support for a two-state solution, is significant and deserves praise. Despite facing criticism from both the left and the right, Lapid's words have the potential to shape the conversation in Israel and influence public opinion. The article suggests that Lapid's bravery in raising the issue, despite political costs, is a sign of his genuine belief in two states as a core Israeli interest. The article also notes that Lapid's words may encourage outside actors to become more involved in the issue, potentially leading to downstream effects and initiatives pertaining to two states. Overall, the article argues that Lapid's speech is an early step in a long journey towards a two-state outcome, and that he deserves credit for taking this step.
